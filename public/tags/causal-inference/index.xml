      <description>This blog post is a beginners guide to the relationship between causation and correlation. In it, I will explain why it makes sense to think about causal explanations for observed correlation, why correlation does not always imply causation, and which alternative causal models to consider when you are trying to figure out why two variables in your data are correlated. The blog post is intended as a non-technical introduction. I use only words and pictures to explain all concepts and logic, and I use a running example from health psychology to illustrate. The post should be relevant to anyone who is interested in using data to understand causal mechanisms.</description>
