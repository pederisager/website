excerpt: Researchers who are planning to conduct a replication study need to consider not only how to design a replication study in a rigorous and efficient way, but also which original claim is most in need of replication. At present, we have tended to focus much more on the former problem than the latter. However, the question of what to replicate is becoming increasingly important. The empirical literature grows at an accelerating rate. In addition, most of the existing literature consists of non-replicated original research. Given the resources available for research, it is therefore very unlikely that we will be able to replicate all claims in the existing literature. So which claims do we focus on? In this talk Peder will present a model for the general decision problem “what to replicate?”. He will outline some criteria and strategies for study selection that have been proposed in the literature, and show how these are related to the general decision problem. Finally, he will offer some suggestions for how to select replication studies in your own field of interest.
